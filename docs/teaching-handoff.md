# Teaching Handoff

This file is for any future ChatGPT/Codex session continuing the course.

## Read first

Before teaching or editing the project, read:

1. `docs/course-roadmap.md`
2. the most recent Step documentation
3. the corresponding tracked notebook under `notebooks/`

## Current state

Repository lesson-material preparation:

```text
Steps 1–8.5  material prepared
Step 9.1      material prepared; static audit passed
Step 9.2      current material prepared
Step 9.3+     planned only; not current
```

**Material status is not learner status.** No claim is made that the learner has completed the Step 9.2 work notebook, completed exercises, or mastered vanishing/exploding gradients.

Do not enter Step 9.3 until the learner explicitly asks to proceed beyond Step 9.2.

## Non-negotiable teaching constraints

The learner asked for **small, digestible teaching turns**, but not absurdly fragmented micro-steps.

From Step 4 onward:

- maximum 5 subsections per Step;
- the cap is organizational, not a brevity target: each subsection must be sufficiently complete and deep, including prerequisite reasoning, intuitive examples, shape tracing, and important caveats;
- each subsection should contain roughly 2x the content of the earliest Step-3 micro-lessons;
- introduce mathematics only when needed;
- assume only simple matrix multiplication as the starting mathematical baseline;
- use small hand-computable examples;
- use plots where they materially improve intuition (e.g. geometry, distributions, loss curves, optimization, benchmarks), and teach the small plotting technique inline without turning the course into a plotting tutorial;
- explain theory → meaning/history → code;
- explain why a design exists, not only how to call an API;
- explicitly correct oversimplifications when needed;
- avoid dumping an entire architecture in one reply.

Primary language: Chinese, with important English technical terms included.

## Hardware / environment assumptions

- Apple Silicon Mac
- current teaching machine: M-series Mac with constrained memory relative to server GPUs
- project aims for low heat and low memory
- Python 3.12
- `.venv`
- `uv`
- Apple MLX
- VS Code + Jupyter Notebook

Do not switch the core implementation to PyTorch.

## Notebook workflow

Tracked master notebooks:

```text
notebooks/*.ipynb
```

The learner should not execute or modify them.

Local practice notebooks:

```text
notebooks/work/*_work.ipynb
```

These are ignored by Git.

Normal post-setup lesson workflow:

1. At the beginning of the lesson response, give `git pull` in its own shell code block.
2. Immediately after it, give the lesson-specific `cp notebooks/<lesson>.ipynb notebooks/work/<lesson>_work.ipynb` in a second, separate shell code block.
3. Do not combine the two commands into one code block.
4. Under normal conditions, do not stop and wait for terminal output between these two routine commands.
5. If Git/copying reports an error, conflict, unexpected existing work copy, or other abnormal state, then switch to one-command-at-a-time troubleshooting and wait for output after each diagnostic/fix command.
6. Do not invent recurring setup commands such as `mkdir -p notebooks/work`; the work directory already exists.
7. Use the normal plain `cp` command unless troubleshooting specifically requires another form.

Then the learner works only in the `_work.ipynb` copy.

When adding a lesson:

1. create/update the tracked master notebook;
2. update the relevant `docs/` note;
3. commit to `main`;
4. tell the learner the exact `git pull` and `cp` commands.

## Accuracy requirements

Avoid repeating these earlier oversimplifications:

- embedding width does **not** need to be >= vocabulary size;
- learned embeddings do **not** guarantee neat human-interpretable clusters;
- dot product is not automatically cosine similarity;
- unmasked self-attention without positional signals is permutation-equivariant, but a causal mask itself is position-dependent and breaks full arbitrary-permutation symmetry; do not claim causal masking and positional encoding are the same mechanism;
- attention heads are not literally mapped one-to-one to physical GPU cores;
- a residual connection helps information/gradient flow but does not mathematically guarantee no information loss;
- causal masks should not accidentally be registered as trainable parameters;
- MLX `Linear.weight` storage shape must be described according to the actual MLX API.

## Historical storyline

The course should maintain this causal development chain:

```text
MLP
→ RNN
→ BPTT limitations
→ LSTM/GRU
→ Seq2Seq bottleneck
→ Attention
→ Self-Attention
→ Transformer
→ Decoder-Only GPT
→ modern LLM improvements
```

Each new architecture should be introduced as a response to a concrete limitation of the previous one.

## Immediate next action

Current course-material checkpoint:

> **Step 9.2 — Vanishing and exploding gradients**

Step 9.2 material is prepared only. Do not infer learner mastery or exercise completion, and do not create, teach, or mark Step 9.3 as current unless the learner explicitly asks to proceed.

## 2026-10-08 continuity re-audit

Before Step 8.1, verified the live main tree, all 26 tracked master Notebooks (01–26), Steps 01–07 documentation, full roadmap, and learner agreements. See `docs/course-continuity-check-2026-10-08.md`. Do not conflate position-wise MLP with a flattened whole-sequence MLP. The former lacks cross-token mixing; the latter can mix tokens but has fixed-length input-width trade-offs.

## Step 9.2 accuracy boundary

Teach vanishing/exploding gradients from temporal derivative/Jacobian products. Use `0.5^n` and `1.5^n` only as scalar toy intuition; for vector RNNs emphasize state-dependent `D_k`, direction-dependent Jacobian action, transpose/order from the column-gradient convention, and that a single matrix can shrink some directions while growing others. Explain L2/global gradient norm before using MLX 0.32.2 `mlx.optimizers.clip_grad_norm`. Clipping mitigates excessive gradient magnitude but does not repair vanishing credit, tanh saturation, or long recurrent paths. Do not enter LSTM/Step 9.3 during Step 9.2 delivery.
